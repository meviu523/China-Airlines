# 原创飞机分层资源 v4

> 历史生成记录，仅用于复现现役v5兼容资源。新飞机不得沿用本目录的近侧蒙皮与合成外观流程，当前规则见 `docs/UNIFIED-AIRCRAFT-CANVAS.md`。

2026-09-15–16，内置 image_gen 生成。先提交初航号预览，用户“实施修改”后展开剩余机型；按后续确认删除历史机型及兼容支持，只交付现役13种。

每个 `*-source.png` 是1536×1024原始透明图集。第一行0..590为剖面机身，第二行590..1024为近侧蒙皮、机翼/发动机。`scripts/extract-aircraft-layers.ps1`只裁切和按坐标合成，不替代绘画或将一个机体换色冒充另一机型。每机型三张运行PNG共39张：cutaway、near与由前两层合成的exterior。两层注册位置在 `src/ui/aircraft-layer-layouts.json`；runtime场景使用相同坐标。

初航号和雨燕为小型螺旋桨、苍鹭为尾置喷气、信天翁为双发、极光为四发示意；各客/货/混合型有独立舱壁、舷窗、舱门、尾翼标记与发动机细节，均朝左。未宣称对应真实机型或精确结构。

透明处理要求：移除背景棋盘格及光晕，输出真实alpha通道，保留飞机与蒙皮实心；不完整输出经image_gen再次修复，最终原稿与运行图均做透明度检查。源文件保留在本目录；生成服务原文件保留在generated_images。

Production sprite atlas for ONE original game aircraft, STARTER SWIFT. Use approved sheet as design reference: cute thick blue/white/gold left-facing small turboprop. Output 1536x1024 TRANSPARENT RGBA two-row registered layer atlas. NO titles text numbers ground shadows or scenery. Each row is an identical 1536x512 local canvas; do not crop frames differently.
TOP ROW base layer: whole left-facing aircraft from x30 to1500. Nose x30..260, tail x1270..1500, body roof y90, belly y415, wheels to y490, low tail y20. Central cutaway opening x270..1250 y100..410, rounded corners. It is a TALL TWO-DECK aircraft; upper passenger room occupies y100..285, lower cargo room y285..410. Show empty ivory upper wall with windows, empty grey lower wall and a floor beam. NO SEATS, NO PALLETS, NO PEOPLE, NO BOXES (dynamic game sprites will go here). Cutaway body frame and far-side wing/gear only; absolutely no near-side engine or wing crossing the opening.
BOTTOM ROW near-side overlay ONLY: use same local canvas coordinates but add y512. Opaque near-side body skin EXACTLY spanning local x255..1270 y90..420, following the base opening border. White top, blue lower cargo belly, gold line; upper oval windows with opaque glass; lower small cargo door. Include the near-side swept wing and ONE turboprop engine projected outward at local x690..1040 y330..480. Omit nose before x255, tail after x1270, far wing and landing wheels: they stay on base. Blank outside near-side skin/wing/engine must be true alpha zero. It must overlay the top row directly when translated upward512px. Same scale, camera, dimensions, lighting. Small vintage-looking rounded starter, short nose, compact low tail with a gold tip, cream fairings.
Crucial: two aligned layers of ONE plane, not two separate complete aircraft; no baked furniture; keep skin fully opaque across both cabin rows.

Create TWO separated layers of ONE new aircraft for a Chinese airline management game. Use reference only for cute pixel-painted ORIGINAL blue/white style, NOT the same airframe silhouette. ALBATROSS passenger widebody TWIN TURBOFAN airliner. Unique bigger broad rounded nose, broad LOW trapezoid tail with teal triangular inlay, strong cobalt belly and gold trim. Two large UNDERWING jet engines, far one belongs in base at lower edge and near one belongs ONLY in detached overlay. NO propellers or rear mounted engines. ONE full-height passenger cabin, no floor division, opaque window glass in shell.
Output transparent RGBA 1536x1024. The top 590px row contains WHOLE aircraft left facing, nose around x20 y330, tail at x1300..1510 y50..400, gear to y565. The cutaway opening occupies x280..1280 y175..470. Empty interior only no chairs people boxes pallets. Far side details only, near wing and engine must not obscure opening.
The bottom region y630..1000 is only a DETACHED near-side body SKIN panel and near wing/engine, no nose before x260, NO tail beyond x1290. Opaque skin covers x265..1280 y645..907. The lower detached panel must be a continuous opaque white and blue sidewall with trim, including opaque window glass where applicable; it is used to conceal the full open cabin. Near wing and engine hang below and may extend up to x1450. No duplicate whole aircraft, no labels, no shadows or checkerboard. Both are separately crop-able sprites; matching perspective, side cutaway with shallow top view, not rotate whole fuselage. Preserve alpha zero background.
